**Academic Use & Course Policy Notice**

This repository is public with permission. However, use of this work is subject to the University of Illinois ECE 385 academic integrity policy.

At the time of writing, ECE 385 allows the use of publicly accessible code only if:

-Proper credit is given and the contributor’s own work is clearly distinguished from reused material

-All licensing requirements are respected

-The code was not created as part of another ECE 385 project, nor a substantially similar project targeting the Urbana FPGA board

This project contains a number of highly reusable hardware and software components (e.g., custom IP, graphics/video infrastructure, memory interfaces, and firmware structure). Because of this, it would be easy to produce a project that is considered substantially similar with relatively minor modifications.

For that reason, this repository should be viewed strictly as inspiration or high-level reference. Students are strongly encouraged to build their own implementations from first principles or from course-approved starting points.

I cannot be responsible for any academic integrity violations, grading consequences, or plagiarism accusations resulting from improper use of this code. If you are unsure whether a particular use is allowed, you should consult the ECE 385 course staff before incorporating any ideas or components.
